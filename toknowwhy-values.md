# 2ØY's (To Know Why) Values

### 0.1 Our Calling

We are not customers, not users, not "the masses." We are peers, equal. We assume responsibility for ourselves, each other, and our planet Earth.

In the dawn of the open digital cryptographic accounting networks, we strive to impact the industry by building an infrastructure that enhances peer-to-peer cooperation and competition.

### 0.2 A Note on Facebook's Ledger Design

In light of Facebook's Diem (previously named Libra), we chose to design this document to respond to Diem's ledger design statements. 

Our findings teach us that Diem will be a software architecture that is not a peer-to-peer ledger; it will be governed by a hand-picked central group of server providers and backed by centralized fiat money. This architecture follows the current model that Facebook and many other Internet companies have built.

In direct opposition, we see the current master/slave model of the Internet as a threat to humanity's future, and we strive to create a new model far away from it. We believe in peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, encouraging human cooperation through trustless verifiability, promoting equality, sovereignty, and privacy for all. 



## 1 Vision

2ØY's vision is to be the home of **The Blocktree**, the boundless-throughput lowest-latency distributed value storage and liquidity network; and **The Unit**, the crypto-native unit of account for the metaverse.

We are building 2ØY because the world demands greater equality, greater privacy, and greater liberty, more so than ever before. We call for high-quality human/software/hardware architectures that actualize permissionless value transfer and storage.

We are creating this document to let the world know that we are here to support decentralization, build software that expands our human liberties, and establish a community surrounding these efforts.

## 2 Evolution of Money, Society, and Liberty

To convey the breadth and depth of 2ØY, we introduce three stories about human evolution that present our vision of the field of distributed electronic money. These three stories talk about the central pillars of our human connections: money, society, and liberty.

### 2.1 Evolution of Money

Before we had money, we trusted ourselves and each other to keep our debts in our memory. However, when social groups grew in size, we began using objects to help us count and record: from long bones with markings like those found in the Ishango bone dating back to 20 thousand years ago to the metallic coins and cotton-linen bills still in use today. These objects helped us create liquidity and facilitate trade agreements; they have continuously improved, and their complexity has evolved up to this day.

Because of the immense usefulness of money and our ongoing fascination with the concept, some people set themselves to create institutions to control the issuance and movement of funds. Many of us trust these major third parties today, and still, a majority trust them with all of their liquid savings. 

In our contemporary society, much of the money is issued and controlled by central banks. Operating through these banks, small groups of people decide for the remaining billions without the necessary transparency and worldwide consensus. Moreover, the responsibility that lies in these institutions is too large for any small group of people.

However, thanks to the Internet and the subsequent enlargement of our collective mind, we can again create liquidity that is not tied to external objects or managed by central banks. Now we have cryptographic data structures managed by peer-to-peer distributed timestamp servers. These new types of liquidity have the properties of our original internalized debt counting system: they are distributed among all participants and communicated through peer-to-peer networks. We can now redistribute the risks from the very few central banking institutions to numerous open ledgers (networks) that bring ownership and responsibility to all.

### 2.2 Evolution of Society

Since the beginning of civilization, the advancement of societies has grown together with energy consumption. At first, the control of fire by Homo Erectus around 1 million years ago became the single most crucial step in improving life quality: keeping everyone warm in the winters and allowing us to cook food significantly reduced the spread of diseases.
Since then, we have continuously grown our energy consumption and found an increasing variety of energy sources. We have also seen many uses for the energy we can harness. The energy consumption of our global society is now a staggering multiple of that of the late Roman Empire, and our lives have improved enormously due to this rise of available power.

However, if we dream of reaching other stars outside our solar system, we need to increase our energy consumption by an even more significant multiple. 

2ØY's mission is to help amplify our energy usage by attaching value transfer and storage resources to our energy production through The Blocktree project. As renewable sources become the most affordable energy source, we envision The Blocktree playing an essential role in accelerating this transition to renewables. Transforming energy directly into monetary units by rewarding energy expenditure with money is the most powerful way to increase energy output and motivate us to develop more cost-efficient energy solutions.

### 2.3 Evolution of Freedom

Originally freedom was innate to all humans. However limited, we were all born free. On the other hand, the large-scale cooperation needed to create distributed wealth and well-being has proven hard to maintain, and disputes arise frequently. Despite living in an era where consensus and improved living conditions are a reality, the situation has sadly perpetuated to this day.

When larger groups formed, humans created servitude: physical slavery and many forms of mental submission became standard practices. These practices worked to build a long-term constrained and partially-forced cooperation. The use of persuasion through fear and violence unleashed a burst of human productivity that only our species could unlock on Earth.

However cruel and unforgiving, these systems perpetuated for thousands of years until they became undesirable in recent history. Only within the last few hundred years has slavery become a dying practice regarded as inhumane and deplorable. Thanks to the improvement of equality, slaves and even slave owners saved themselves from the burdens of slavery.

The destruction of the systems of slavery increased human equality, and aided by education, has also increased productivity. The abolition of slavery has uncovered a human potential more extraordinary than what was possible before.

Physical slavery was outright abolished through local consensus and international cooperation, spreading broader capitalism which created massive productivity growth and helped empower the first and second industrial revolutions. Capitalism and the industrial revolution turned the paid laborer into the preferred means of production for our society. 

We are now walking the first steps of ending mental slavery: a small group's control over currency units. As central banks give up their control over trading volumes, national and supranational currencies, the nation-states and related constructions become weakened.
Step by step, our liberties and responsibilities to create open accounting infrastructures grow stronger and free our minds from the borders installed through racism and nationalism. Similar to the end of physical slavery, the process of opening currencies to peer-to-peer structures will save both all humans and central bankers from the risks and burdens of the practice of central banking.

Since its inception in 2019, 2ØY's mission has stood as a portal to unbind us all from the type of mental slavery prolonged by the central control of counting units. The Blocktree stands to spread the risk of transaction verification among all participants, freeing humanity's potential from the limitations of the current structures.

## 3 Problem Statement

The assumption that people cannot make their own monetary choices, that we need to get help, handheld brought into financial inclusion, is no longer valid in a world of increasingly more educated and highly-skilled people. We can assume that more and more people will validate the authenticity of their financial applications and their money on their own.
The three main challenges we are addressing are:

1. Centralization: the status quo in which private corporations (governments, banks, technology companies, etc.) control our financial data is a dreadful state of affairs.

2. Shortage of sound money: choices that can pass the test of time and stand fit for the digital age are very limited.

3. Scaling: current P2P money infrastructures are preparing to meet the demand and are getting ready to use the necessary resources to equip everyone for the changing world but aren't quite there yet.

We discuss these issues below and briefly summarize the reasons why 2ØY is fit to solve these challenges.

### 3.1 Centralization 

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto provided a solution to the double-spending problem without needing a trusted third party. The original implementation, Bitcoin, has been working successfully since 2009. However, most money in use is centrally issued, requiring trusted third parties to store and transact, the biggest hurdle to overcome both technologically and psychologically.

The centralization of money through central banking solved many issues with previous models, but it also created new problems. Right now, central bankers have an enormous amount of responsibility. We can argue that the level of commitment held by the bankers is undesirable even to them. In these terms, 2ØY will free central bankers from the responsibility of managing the world's money. Instead, 2ØY will distribute the responsibility to all participants in the consensus and governance protocols openly.

### 3.2 Shortage of sound money 

The world of money is full of poor choices. Most of the funds used today require that humans need to trust multiple third-party institutions. 

We redefine sound money as money functioning without a central issuer or a central settlement provider. Given the difficulty of an object standing as money for a long time, there have been few examples of sound money in history. The primary models fitting these criteria are the metals gold and silver. Because of their natural properties, these two metals have passed the test of time. However, difficulties storing them and transferring them across the globe make them unfit for the digital age.

The new source of sound money comes from the creation of Bitcoin; this coin and all its analogs have served as a new source of high-quality funds. Bitcoin is a relatively recent invention that is starting to alter the course of human behavior. As of this day, its usage is limited. The Blocktree focuses on expanding the capabilities of this new type of sound money.

#### 3.3 Scaling 

Scaling solutions to Bitcoin's network structure have been developing over the last few years. However, we must still undertake much research and implementation efforts to reach the necessary performance levels successfully.

The two types of distributed scaling being implemented and thought of today are on-chain scaling and second-layer scaling solutions, both currently having flaws. However, thanks to our progressive parallelization of blockchain data, The Blocktree aims to offer a completely decentralized scaling solution with a new scaling structure.

## 4 The Opportunity

Thanks to our analysis of the past, we maintain three critical visions for the future of humanity:

* Humanity as an organism is expanding: Thanks to the Internet and cryptocurrencies, humans are becoming more connected than ever before, giving unparalleled opportunities for growth as a united species.

* Humans should have the opportunity to govern themselves financially: As the global level of education related to productive and beneficial social conduct continues to rise rapidly, each of us can take greater responsibility in self-governance.

* Both our individual and collective dreams can coexist: The narratives around what we can accomplish as a species and what individuals can aspire to attain in their lifetimes are consistent with each other.

This vision empowers us to restart our society's foundational ledger rewriting it into distributed ledgers.

## 5 Introducing The Blocktree

The world needs multiple competing P2P transfer-store ledgers, a truly distributed set with various risks and strengths. In this new paradigm, many new transactional networks are emerging, and The Blocktree strives to be the one that offers the most remarkable improvements.

The Blocktree aspires to be a secure and intuitive ledger by putting together and backing extraordinary people. We spare no effort to continue this mission and to expand the current capabilities of the technology.

Unlike Facebook's Diem, which argues that moving money should be "even more secure than sending a text message or sharing a photo," we support true decentralization and edge security. Moreover, there is no comparison since Facebook's current platforms do those functions using central servers that turn users into monetized products.

The building blocks of The blocktree:

1. The Blocktree is built on a secure, scalable, and reliable structure
2. The Blocktree is backed by energy and the process of finding hashes (mining) 
3. The Blocktree is governed through network consensus.

The Blocktree focus is to uphold Bitcoin's original values and lift them to a more significant technological paradigm. Bitcoin's blockchain dissolves the need to trust a third party to prevent double-spending. However, the entire value of Diem stays within a dominant third party, the Diem Association, which holds the total amount of assets for all users. In The Blocktree, all the participants store value in their private keys; there are no mere users in this network.

If you support the development of decentralized technologies, you support the development of The Blocktree.

## 6 The Blocktree

As the saying goes: "Money does not grow on trees." However, in The Blocktree, money is designed to grow in a directed tree, a directed graph without cycles (DAG). However, the construction differs from the usual DAG constructions.

The Blocktree builds on a variant of the immensely popularised bitcoin blockchain devised by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. This variant initially implements a blockchain or trunk, which prepares to split its resources at planned intervals to expand into a multi-network infrastructure.

The initial design supports a growing network of branches; each splits once per year for the first ten years. This design implements a binary splitting, and after ten years, it will contain 1024 leaves. Passed the initial ten-years period, the splitting would happen every two years and subsequently every four years.

The difficulty and the reward split evenly between two new leaves at every instance of a planned network partition. Thus, this process has the effect of dividing the hashing power evenly between the two leaves.

As of the writing of this document, The Blocktree testnet plans to go live in early 2022, with the mainnet genesis launching a few months after the testnet. Details of the design will soon be available as a technical report.

## 7 The Blocktree Resources

The focus of the resources stored in The Blocktree ledger is to serve as a currency and value storage. Unlike Diem, The Blocktree resources are not a derivative of Fiat money. Instead, a distributed permissionless peer-to-peer network backs the resources.

The stability of The Blocktree resources is directly proportional to the growth of its trade volume and its usage evolution as value reserve and form of exchange. To move in this direction, 2ØY will invest in network growth and real volume growth.

The initial distribution of The Blocktree resources is released to allow the starting point of a collaborative effort to support it. All contributions will go towards moving forward the development of The Blocktree.

## 8 The Unit: A Crypto-Native Unit of Account

Accounting units for our everyday financial language don't necessarily have to be currencies; they can be units generated through ranking and other algorithmic methods. Our asset aggregation algorithm aims to create an accounting unit that can replace fiat money as the standard unit of account. Additionally, a widely adopted asset aggregation algorithm and the corresponding unit can serve as the global index.

Our Asset Aggregation Algorithm will create the Metaverse Accounting Unit (The Unit) by collecting information from many crypto networks, similar to how Google's page rank generates a ranking of the world's web pages. However, in this case, the result will be a unit corresponding to its respective electronic resources. The goal is to create a unit of exchange that all networks can agree on and bring stability to the cryptocurrency space.

With this in mind, we are proposing a wallet that expands the current operability of electronic resources. It will use The Unit as the standard unit of account.

The application of this wallet is that it will allow many different coins to be used in commerce regardless of the sender's and receiver's preferred coins for value transfer and storage.

## 9 2ØY (To Know Why)

We part from the experience that mathematics is the only presence that stands immutable across time and space. While science changes over time through observation, mathematics stands as a universal constant. For instance, the Pythagorean theorem was as true when observed by Pythagoras as it is now on Earth and in the farthest points of our observable universe.

We created computers by applying mathematics to atoms and then developed the code to make those computers useful using mathematics again. As a result, the code we have created now runs the majority of our societal relationships. And we now live with the questions of how to live with this code. 

The Internet has evolved as a network of leading centralized services, where most people are at the user level. However, we envision a future where we all participate as peers, a new era of distributed value instead of centralized value.

The previous paragraphs state the foundational elements which embody 2ØY, a basis of what we do and the values we stand for. The purpose of 2ØY is to increase liberty and equality for all humanity by expanding the code, mainly through the evolution of code designed to allow and express The Blocktree and The Unit.

2ØY will aid in developing The Blocktree through the management of the 2ØY development fund. However, 2ØY has no direct control over the network, which runs entirely as an open-source project.

Unlike the Diem Association, 2ØY does not have any authorized resellers or authority over the distributed peer-to-peer network. Furthermore, rather than waiting for years to start a transition into decentralization, The Blocktree is fully designed to offer raw decentralization from day one.

## 10 What's next for 2ØY?

We recently launched the 20Y.org website and our vision for the project. We plan to launch The Blocktree testnet in early 2022, with the mainnet launching on June 6, 2022. Until then, we are working to advance the presence, infrastructure, and capabilities of The Unit to help continue our societal decentralization efforts.

Our efforts center around the development and documentation of The Unit and The Blocktree supernetwork. To accomplish our mission of delivering the world's most secure and most intuitive distributed peer-to-peer liquidity and value storage network, we focus on assembling and building state-of-the-art development teams worldwide. These teams will collaborate closely on the open-source projects.

Launching permissionless ecosystems is a slow process of consensus building to decentralization. To optimize this process, we build our network from the ground up. As a result, we look forward to a future in which energy and money connect closely—a better prospect where our money can help expand energy production from renewable sources.

## 11 How to get involved?

We see through the lenses of a conceivable world, borderless and free of imaginary divisive lines. In this world, mining work protects our counting units across the globe and outside the boundaries of Earth. 

We welcome all developers, miners, and anyone willing to contribute to get involved and read our growing documentation. These materials will become available through our channels, primarily at 20y.org. 

In the spirit of decentralization, we welcome contributors from all across the globe to contact us and join our vision.

## 12 Conclusion

2ØY proposes a ledger and product suite that will extend the capabilities of the blockchain and benefit the entire industry. Unlike Diem's ledger design, The Blocktree is based on proven blockchain architecture and backed by a tree of distributed permissionless peer-to-peer networks with proof-of-work consensus.

On top of building a scalable distributed ledger based on proof-of-work, we also propose an algorithm-based unit for measuring network agnostic value, The Unit.

All in all, we are committed to our vision, our goals, and all humans equally. We are here to build the impactful technology the world needs today, and we request everyone's support to achieve our goals.
