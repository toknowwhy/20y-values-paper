# dAbacus: Community and Values

### 0.1 Our Calling

In the dawn of our open digital cryptographic accounting systems, we strive to make a positive impact by building an infrastructure centered on enhancing our peer-to-peer cooperation and competition.
We are not customers, not users, not “the masses”. We are peers, we are equal, and we are humans taking responsibility for ourselves and our planet Earth.

### 0.2 A Note on Diem’s Ledger Design

In light of the release of Facebook’s Diem (previously named Libra), we have chosen to design this document as a response to Diem’s ledger design statements.
Our findings have taught us that Diem will be a software architecture that is not a peer-to-peer ledger; it will be governed by a hand-picked central group of server providers and backed by centralized fiat money. In opposition to Diem’s initial vision, we believe in peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, which strongly encourages human cooperation through trustless verifiability, promoting equality, sovereignty and privacy for all.

## 1 Vision

dAbacus’ vision is to be the world’s most secure and intuitive distributed value storage and liquidity network as well as a hub for decentralized applications.
We are building dAbacus because the world demands greater equality, greater privacy, greater independence and greater liberty, more so than ever before. We call for high-quality human/software/hardware architectures that actualize permissionless value transfer and storage.
We are creating this document to let the world know that we are here to make a difference by supporting decentralization, building software that expands our human liberty, and establishing a community surrounding these efforts.

## 2 Evolution of Money, Society and Liberty

To convey the breadth and depth of dAbacus, we introduce three stories about human evolution that present our vision of the field of distributed electronic money. These three stories talk about the central pillars of our human connections: money, society and liberty.

### 2.1 Evolution of Money

Before we had money, we trusted ourselves and each other to keep our debts in our memory. However, when social groups became too large, we began using objects to help us count and record: from long bones with markings such as those found in the Ishango bone dating back to 20 thousand years ago, to the metallic coins and cotton-linen bills still in use today. These objects helped us create liquidity and facilitate trade agreements; they have continuously improved and their complexity has evolved up to this day.
Because of the immense usefulness of money and our ongoing fascination with the concept, some people set themselves to create institutions to control the issuance and movement of funds. Many of us trust these central third parties today, and still a majority trust them with all of their liquid savings. 

In our contemporary society, much of the money is issued and controlled by central banks. Operating through these banks, small groups of people get to decide for the remaining billions without the necessary transparency and worldwide consensus. Moreover, the responsibility that lies in these institutions is too large for any small group of people.
However, thanks to the Internet and the subsequent enlargement of our collective mind, we can again create liquidity that is not tied to external objects or managed by central banks. Now we have cryptographic data structures managed by peer-to-peer distributed timestamp servers. These new types of liquidity have the properties of our original internalized debt counting system: they are distributed among all participants and communicated through peer-to-peer networks. We can now redistribute the risks from the very few central banking institutions to numerous open ledgers (networks) that bring both ownership and responsibility to all.

### 2.2 Evolution of Society

Since the beginning of civilization, the advancement of societies has been pegged to their growth in energy consumption. In the beginning, the control of fire by Homo Erectus around 1 million years ago became the single most crucial step in improving life quality: keeping everyone warm in the winters and allowing us to cook food that significantly reduced the spread of diseases.
Since then, we have continuously grown our energy consumption and found an increasing variety of energy sources. We have also found many uses for the energy we can harness. The energy consumption of our global society is now a staggering multiple of that of the late Roman Empire, and our lives have improved enormously due to this rise of available power.
However, if we dream of reaching other stars outside our solar system, we need to increase our energy consumption by an even more significant multiple. dAbacus’ mission is to help amplify our energy usage by attaching our value transfer and storage resources to our energy production. As renewable sources become the most affordable energy source, we envision dAbacus as playing an essential role in accelerating this transition to renewables. Transforming energy directly into monetary units by rewarding energy expenditure with money is the most powerful way to increase our energy output and motivate us to develop more cost-efficient energy solutions.

### 2.3 Evolution of Freedom

Originally freedom was innate to all humans. However limited, we were all born free. On the other hand, the large-scale cooperation needed to create distributed wealth and well-being has proven to be very hard to maintain, and disputes were frequent. Despite living in an era where consensus and improved living conditions have been achieved, the situation has sadly perpetuated to this day.

When larger groups formed, humans created servitude: physical slavery and many forms of mental submission became standard practices. These practices worked to build a long-term constrained and partially-forced cooperation. The use of persuasion through fear and violence unleashed a burst of human productivity that only our species could unlock on Earth.

However cruel and unforgiving, these systems perpetuated for thousands of years until they became undesirable in recent history. It is only within the last few hundred years that slavery became a dying practice regarded as inhumane and deplorable. Thanks to the improvement of equality, slaves and even slave owners were saved from the burdens of slavery.

The destruction of the systems of slavery increased human equality, and aided by education, has also increased productivity. The abolition of slavery has uncovered a human potential more extraordinary than what was believed possible.
Physical slavery was outright abolished through local consensus and international cooperation, raising the spread of broader capitalism which created a massive growth of productivity and helped empower the first and second industrial revolution. Conversely, capitalism and the industrial revolution turned the paid laborer into the preferred means of production for our society.
We are now walking the first steps of ending of a form of mental slavery: the control of currency units by a few. As central banks give up their control over trading volumes, national and supranational currencies, the nation-states and related constructions become weakened.
Step by step, our liberties and responsibilities to create open accounting infrastructures grow stronger and free our minds from the borders installed through racism and nationalism. Similar to the end of physical slavery, the process of opening currencies to peer-to-peer structures will save both all humans and central bankers from the risks and burdens of the practice of central banking.

Since its inception in 2019, dAbacus’ mission stood as a portal to unbind us all from the type of mental slavery prolonged by the central control of counting units. dAbacus stands to spread the risk of transaction verification among all participants, freeing humanity’s potential from the limitations of the current structures.

## 3 Problem Statement

The assumption that people cannot make their own monetary choices, that we need to be helped, handheld and brought into financial inclusion, is no longer valid in a world of increasingly more educated and highly-skilled people. We can assume that more and more people will be able to validate the authenticity of their financial applications and their money on their own.
The three main challenges we are addressing are:

1. Centralization: a future where our financial data is controlled by private corporations (governments, banks, technology companies etc.) is a dreadful future.

2. Shortage of good money: choices of good quality money that can pass the test of time and stand fit for the digital age are very limited.

3. Scaling: current P2P money infrastructures aren’t prepared to meet the demand, neither are they ready to use the necessary resources to be equipped for the changing world.

We discuss these issues below and briefly summarize the reasons why dAbacus is fit to solve these challenges.

### 3.1 Centralization 
In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto provided a solution to the double-spending problem without needing a trusted third party. The original implementation, Bitcoin, has been working successfully since 2009. However, most money in use is centrally issued, requiring trusted third parties to store and transact, the biggest hurdle to overcome both technologically and psychologically.
The centralization of money through central banking solved many issues with previous models, but it also created new problems. Right now, central bankers have an enormous amount of responsibility. We can argue that the level of commitment held by the bankers is undesirable even to them. In these terms, dAbacus will free central bankers from the responsibility of managing the world’s money. Instead, dAbacus will distribute the responsibility to all participants in the consensus protocol.

### 3.2 Shortage of good money 
The world of money is plagued with poor choices. Most of the funds being used require that humans need to trust multiple third-party institutions.
We define good money as money functioning in the absence of a central issuer or a central settlement provider. Given the difficulty of an object to stand as money for a long time, examples of good money in history have been few. The primary examples of good money are the metals gold and silver. Because of their natural properties, these two metals have passed the test of time and are still used as money. However, difficulties storing them and transferring them across the globe make them unfit for the digital age.
The new source of good money comes from the creation of Bitcoin; this coin and all its analogs have served as a new source of high quality money. Bitcoin is a relatively recent invention that is starting to alter the course of human behavior. As of this day, its usage is limited, and it is narrowly accepted as money. dAbacus is focused on expanding the capabilities of this new type of good money.

#### 3.3 Scaling 
Scaling solutions to Bitcoin’s network structure are being studied over the last few years. However, much research and implementation efforts must be undertaken to reach the necessary performance levels successfully.
The two types of distributed scaling being implemented and thought of today are on-chain scaling and second-layer scaling solutions, both currently having their flaws. Thanks to our progressive parallelization of blockchain data, dAbacus aims to offer a completely decentralized scaling solution with a new structure called the blocktree.

## 4 The Opportunity

Thanks to having a clearer prospect of our future, we maintain three critical visions for humanity:

* Humanity as an organism is expanding: Thanks to the Internet and cryptocurrencies, humans are becoming more connected than ever before, giving unparalleled opportunities for growth as a united species.

* Humans should have the opportunity to govern their individual selves financially: As the global level of education of productive and beneficial social conduct continues to rise rapidly, each of us can take greater responsibility in self-governance.

* Both our individual and collective dreams can coexist: The narratives around what we can accomplish as a species and what individuals can aspire to attain in their lifetimes are consistent with each other.
This vision empowers us to restart our society's foundational ledger and rewrites it into distributed ledger technology, P2P money.

## 5 Introducing dAbacus

The world needs multiple competing P2P transfer-store ledgers, a truly distributed set with a diversity of risks and strengths. New transactional networks are emerging, and dAbacus strives to be the one that offers the best money.

dAbacus aspires to be a secure and intuitive ledger by putting together and backing extraordinary people. We spare no effort to continue this mission and to expand the current capabilities of the technology.

Unlike Facebook’s Diem, which argues that moving money should be “even more secure than sending a text message or sharing a photo”, we go all out for true decentralization and actual security. There is no comparison since Facebook’s current platforms do those functions using central servers that turn users into products being monetized.

The building blocks of dAbacus:

1. dAbacus is built on a secure, scalable, and reliable blocktree
2. dAbacus is backed by energy and the process of finding hashes (mining) 
3. dAbacus is governed through network consensus.

dAbacus’ focus is to uphold Bitcoin’s original values and lift them to a more significant technological paradigm. Bitcoin’s blockchain dissolves the need to trust a third party to prevent double-spending. However, the entire value of Diem stays within a dominant third party, the Diem Association, which holds the total amount of assets for all the users. In dAbacus, the value is stored by all the participants; there are no mere users in this network.

If you support the development of decentralized technologies, you support the development of dAbacus.

## 6 The dAbacus Blocktree

As the saying goes: “Money does not grow on trees.” However, in dAbacus, money is designed to grow and be secured by a directed tree, a directed graph without cycles (DAG). However, the construction differs from the usual DAG constructions.
dAbacus is based on a variant of the immensely popularised bitcoin blockchain devised by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. This variant initially implements a blockchain or trunk, which prepares to split its resources at planned intervals to expand into a multi-network infrastructure.
The initial design supports a growing network of branches; each splits once per year for the first ten years. This design implements a binary splitting, and after ten years, it will contain 1024 leaves. Passed the initial ten-years period, the splitting would happen every two years and subsequently every four years.
The difficulty and the reward are designed to split evenly between two new leaves at every instance of a planned split. This process would have the effect of dividing the hashing power between the two leaves.
As of the writing of this document, the dAbacus testnet is projected to go live in late 2021 early 2022, with a mainnet being deployed a few months later. Details of the design are scheduled to be released as a technical report shortly after the initial public release of our program.

## 7 dAbacus’ Resources

The focus of the resources stored in the dAbacus Ledger is to serve as a currency and value storage. The dAbacus currency (ABA) is focused on security and ease of use at all levels. Unlike Diem, ABA is not a derivative of Fiat money. ABA is backed by a distributed permissionless peer-to-peer network and the mining work spent increasing its security.

The stability of dAbacus resources is directly proportional to the growth of its trade volume and its usage evolution as value reserve and form of exchange. To move in this direction, 2ØY will invest in network growth and real volume growth.
The initial distribution of the dAbacus resources is being released to allow the starting point of a collaborative effort to support it. All contributions will be used to move forward the development of dAbacus and related activities.

## 8 The Unit: A Crypto-Native Unit of Account

Accounting units for our everyday financial language don’t necessarily have to be currencies; they can be units generated through ranking and other algorithmic methods. The goal of our asset aggregation algorithm is to create an accounting unit that can replace fiat money as the standard unit of account. Additionally, a widely adopted asset aggregation algorithm and the corresponding unit can serve as the global index.
Our Asset Aggregation Algorithm (AAA) will create the World Accounting Unit (The Unit) by collecting information from many crypto networks similarly to how Google’s page rank generates a ranking of the world’s web pages. However, in this case, the result will be a unit corresponding to its respective electronic resources. The goal is to create a unit of exchange that all networks can agree on and bring stability to the cryptocurrency space.
With this in mind, we are producing the dAbax wallet. The dAbax wallet expands the current operability of electronic resources. The Unit will be deployed on dAbax as the standard unit of account.
An essential application of The Unit is that all different coins can be used in commerce regardless of the sender’s and receiver’s preferred coins for value transfer and storage.
This algorithm will be described in dAbax’s technical report.

## 9 2ØY (To Know Why)

We part from the experience that mathematics is the only presence that stands immutable across time and space. While science changes over time through observation, mathematics stands as a universal constant. For instance, the Pythagorean theorem was as true when observed by Pythagoras as it is now, on Earth and in the farthest points of our observable universe.

Since the creation of computers by applying mathematics to the world of atoms, the same mathematics has been used to create code. The code we have created now runs the majority of our societal relationships. We are now presented with the questions of how to interact with this code. 

The internet has evolved as a network of leading centralized services, where most people are relegated to a user level. However, we envision a future where we all participate as peers, a new era of distributed value instead of concentrated.

The previous paragraphs state the foundational elements which embody 2ØY, a basis of what we do and the values we stand for. The purpose of 2ØY within dAbacus and dAbax is to increase liberty and equality for all humanity by expanding the Code, mainly through the evolution of code designed to allow and express the dAbacus network and dAbax’s multi-layer functionalities.

2ØY will aid in developing the network, to be accomplished through the community’s management of dAbacus’ development fund. However, 2ØY has no direct control over the network, which runs entirely as an open-source project.

Unlike the Diem Association, 2ØY does not have any authorized resellers or any authority over the distributed peer-to-peer network. Furthermore, rather than waiting for years to start a transition into decentralization, dAbacus is fully designed to offer raw decentralization from day one.

## 10 What’s next for dAbacus?

We recently launched the dAbacus.org website and our vision for the project. Our testnet is planned to launch in late 2021, with the mainnet launching shortly after. Until then, we are working to provide the best possible applications to help continue our societal decentralization efforts.
Our efforts are centered around the development and documentation of the dAbacus Ledger. To accomplish our mission of delivering the world’s most secure and most intuitive distributed peer-to-peer liquidity and value storage network, we focus on assembling and building state-of-the-art development teams worldwide. These teams are built to collaborate closely with each other on the open-source projects, including and surrounding the dAbacus Ledger.
Launching permissionless ecosystems is a slow process of consensus building. To optimize this process, we build our network from the ground up. We look forward to a future in which energy and money are closely connected—a better prospect where our money can help the expansion of energy production from renewable sources.

## 11 How to get involved?

We see through the lenses of a conceivable world, borderless and free of imaginary divisive lines. In this world, our counting units are created and protected by mining work done all across the globe as well as outside the boundaries of Earth.
We welcome all developers, miners, and anyone willing to contribute to get involved and read the documentation. These materials will become available through our many different channels, primarily at dAbacus.org.
We will include as many means of communication as possible to welcome contributors from all across the globe.

## 12 Conclusion

dAbacus proposes a ledger and product suite that will extend the capabilities of the blockchain and benefit the entire industry. Unlike Diem’s ledger design, dAbacus is based on proven blockchain architecture and backed by a tree of distributed permissionless peer-to-peer networks with proof-of-work consensus.
On top of building a scalable distributed ledger based on proof-of-work, we also propose an algorithm-based unit for measuring network agnostic value.
All in all, we are committed to our vision, our goals and all humans equally. We are here to build the most impactful technology the world needs today, and we request everyone’s support to achieve our goals.
